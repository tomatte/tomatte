### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my place!!!

I'm cadet at 42 School of Software Engineering. Currently focused both on finishing the 42 Common Core and on building my knowledge through personal projects.
Programming for me is like a never-ending puzzle game very fun (and sometimes very stressing) to play.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C, C++, JS/TS, NestJS and NextJS.
